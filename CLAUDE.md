# CLAUDE.md — Claude Code specifics

Everything above arrives from `AGENTS.md`, the tool-neutral instruction set,
which applies here unchanged; this file adds only what depends on Claude Code.

**Declaring a plugin in `.claude/settings.json` does not install it.** Run
`claude plugin install compound-engineering@compound-engineering-plugin` and
`claude plugin install trellis@kodhama` once per machine (user scope covers
every checkout), then start a fresh session: an install does not reach a
session already running.

Do not put `permissions.defaultMode` in `.claude/settings.json`: a project
value shadows the maintainer's user-level one.
